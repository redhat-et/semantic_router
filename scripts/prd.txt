Product Requirements Document: DistilBERT Dual-Purpose Classification Integration

Project Overview:
Implement a dual-purpose classification system using DistilBERT to perform both category classification and PII (Personal Identifiable Information) detection within the semantic router project. The goal is to optimize memory usage by using a single model for both tasks.

Key Requirements:

1. Model Architecture
- Use DistilBERT base uncased model as the foundation
- Implement dual classification heads:
  * Category/topic classification head
  * PII detection token classification head
- Ensure memory efficiency through shared model architecture
- Support model quantization for production deployment

2. Development Requirements
- Create proof-of-concept implementation in Python using HuggingFace
- Port implementation to Rust using the candle framework
- Implement comprehensive testing at all levels
- Maintain compatibility with existing semantic router interfaces
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous inference

3. Performance Requirements
- Minimize memory footprint through shared model architecture
- Support model quantization for production deployment
- Maintain reasonable inference speed (target: <100ms per request)
- Handle both classification tasks in a single pass
- Support batched inference for improved throughput

4. Integration Requirements
- Seamless integration with existing semantic router codebase
- Support for configuration of both classification tasks
- Clear API design for accessing both classification results
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

5. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for the complete system
- Performance benchmarking suite
- Memory usage monitoring
- Test coverage for edge cases and error conditions

6. Documentation Requirements
- Clear API documentation
- Usage examples
- Performance characteristics
- Deployment guidelines
- Troubleshooting guide

Technical Constraints:
- Must use DistilBERT base uncased model
- Must implement in both Python (POC) and Rust (production)
- Must maintain compatibility with existing semantic router interfaces
- Must optimize for memory usage
- Must support both classification tasks in single pass

Success Criteria:
1. Successfully performs both category and PII classification
2. Memory usage optimized through shared model
3. Maintains acceptable inference speed
4. Comprehensive test coverage
5. Production-ready Rust implementation
6. Clear documentation and examples
7. Seamless integration with existing system
