# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with necessary structure for both Python and Rust implementations, including dependency management, CI/CD configuration, and development environment setup.
# Details:
1. Create a new repository with appropriate .gitignore
2. Set up Python environment with requirements.txt including:
   - transformers
   - torch
   - pytest
   - semantic_router (existing package)
3. Set up Rust environment with Cargo.toml including:
   - candle-core
   - candle-nn
   - candle-transformers
   - tokenizers
4. Configure CI/CD pipeline for testing both Python and Rust implementations
5. Create directory structure:
   ```
   /
   ├── python/
   │   ├── src/
   │   └── tests/
   ├── rust/
   │   ├── src/
   │   └── tests/
   ├── examples/
   ├── benchmarks/
   └── docs/
   ```

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all dependencies install correctly and development environments can be set up with a single command. Test CI/CD pipeline with a simple smoke test for both Python and Rust environments.
