# Cache Hit Headers Debugging Log

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**
- **Frontend Issue**: Shows 0.0% cache hit rate despite backend logs showing 91.38% cache hits
- **Symptom**: Cache headers (`x-cache-hit`) appear in browser dev tools but with **empty values**
- **CORS Error**: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin header contains invalid value ''"
- **Impact**: Cache functionality works perfectly in backend, but frontend cannot detect cache hits

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Confirmed Working Components**
1. ✅ **Backend cache logic** (`cache.go` FindSimilar()) works correctly
2. ✅ **Router logs** show proper cache detection: "similarity=0.8888, threshold=0.7500" → Cache hit
3. ✅ **ExtProc logic** (`extproc.go`) correctly sets cache headers in immediate responses
4. ✅ **Frontend logic** correctly checks `response.headers['x-cache-hit'] === 'true'`

### **Core Technical Issue**
**Hypothesis**: Envoy strips header **values** from ExtProc immediate responses while allowing header **names** through.

**Evidence**:
- Headers appear in browser dev tools with names but empty values
- Backend logs show cache working perfectly
- ExtProc code correctly sets headers before sending immediate response

**Technical Root Cause**: ExtProc immediate responses bypass Envoy's normal HTTP filter pipeline, including CORS processing, leading to header value stripping and CORS conflicts.

## 🧪 **Debugging Attempts**

### **❌ Attempt 1: Add CORS Headers to Immediate Response**
**Date**: During debugging session
**Approach**: Added CORS headers directly to immediate response in `extproc.go` and `response.go`
**Code Changes**: 
```go
// Added to immediate response headers
"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"
"Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type, x-cache-hit"
"Access-Control-Expose-Headers": "x-cache-hit"
```

**Result**: ❌ **FAILED**
**Error**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin header contains invalid value ''`
**Analysis**: Conflict between route-level CORS config in `envoy.yaml` and immediate response headers. Envoy's CORS filter and immediate response CORS headers interfered with each other.

**Lesson Learned**: Cannot mix route-level CORS configuration with immediate response CORS headers.

---

### **❌ Attempt 2: Response Body Processing Approach**
**Date**: During debugging session  
**Approach**: Complete architectural change - store cached responses, let requests continue normally through pipeline, replace response body during response processing
**Code Changes**:
```go
// Added to OpenAIRouter struct
cachedResponses map[string]CachedResponse

// Modified cache hit logic to use normal pipeline
// Stored cached response in map instead of immediate response
// Processed response body in response headers phase
```

**Result**: ❌ **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE**
**Error**: 500 Internal Server Error - broke entire backend processing
**Analysis**: Modifying core request/response flow disrupted normal Envoy processing. The approach was too invasive and broke fundamental request handling.

**Lesson Learned**: Response body modification approach is too risky and breaks normal processing flow.

**Emergency Action**: ✅ **Immediate revert** to original immediate response approach restored functionality.

---

## 📊 **Current Status** (After Emergency Revert)

### **✅ Working State**
- ✅ Backend functionality fully restored
- ✅ Cache works correctly in backend logs (91.38% hit rate)  
- ✅ JavaScript errors resolved (`cacheStep` element added)
- ✅ Classification display logic fixed (handles 'mock' source)
- ✅ Performance optimized (removed delays in live mode)
- ✅ System stable and performant

### **❌ Remaining Issue**
- ❌ Frontend still shows 0% cache hit rate 
- ❌ Original CORS header access issue **unsolved**
- ❌ Cache headers still have empty values in browser

### **🏗️ Current Architecture (Working)**
```
1. Router detects cache hit (✅ working)
2. ExtProc returns immediate response with cache headers (✅ working)  
3. Envoy strips header VALUES while keeping header NAMES (🔍 suspected issue)
4. Frontend sees headers with empty values (❌ problem)
5. CORS error prevents header access (❌ problem)
```

## 🔬 **Technical Deep Dive**

### **Envoy ExtProc Immediate Response Behavior**
- **Confirmed**: Immediate responses bypass normal HTTP filter pipeline
- **Confirmed**: Normal pipeline includes CORS processing
- **Suspected**: Envoy may strip header values from immediate responses for security reasons
- **Suspected**: CORS exposure requires headers to flow through CORS filter

### **CORS Configuration Analysis**
**Current setup** (`envoy.yaml`):
```yaml
cors:
  allow_origin_string_match:
    - prefix: "*"
  allow_methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
  allow_headers: content-type,x-requested-with,authorization,x-cache-hit
  expose_headers: x-cache-hit
```

**Issue**: Route-level CORS config expects headers to flow through normal pipeline, but immediate responses bypass this.

## 🎯 **Next Research Directions**

### **🔍 Priority 1: Envoy ExtProc + CORS Documentation Research**
- [ ] Research Envoy documentation on ExtProc immediate response header handling
- [ ] Investigate if there's a way to make immediate response headers flow through CORS filter
- [ ] Look for Envoy configuration options for ExtProc header exposure

### **🔍 Priority 2: Alternative Technical Approaches**
- [ ] **Response Header Processing**: Instead of immediate response, process in response_headers phase
- [ ] **Custom Header Handling**: Use different header approach that doesn't conflict with CORS
- [ ] **ExtProc Configuration**: Research if ExtProc can be configured to preserve header values

### **🔍 Priority 3: Response Processing Without Body Modification**
- [ ] Investigate response header modification without touching response body
- [ ] Research if headers can be added in response_headers phase while preserving cache benefits

## 🚨 **Critical Guidelines for Future Attempts**

### **✅ Safe Practices**
1. **Always test in isolation** - make small, targeted changes
2. **Preserve working functionality** - ensure current cache logic remains untouched
3. **Document each attempt** thoroughly before trying
4. **Have rollback plan** ready before making changes

### **❌ Avoid These Approaches**
1. **DON'T** mix route-level CORS with immediate response CORS headers
2. **DON'T** modify core request/response flow without extensive testing
3. **DON'T** change response body processing without understanding full implications
4. **DON'T** make multiple architectural changes simultaneously

### **🔬 Research-First Approach**
- Before implementing any solution, research Envoy documentation thoroughly
- Look for existing solutions or similar issues in Envoy community
- Understand the full implications of any architectural changes
- Test with minimal changes first

## 📈 **Success Metrics**
- [ ] Frontend shows accurate cache hit percentage matching backend logs
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console
- [ ] Headers accessible via `response.headers['x-cache-hit']`
- [ ] Backend cache functionality preserved (91.38% hit rate maintained)
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] System remains stable under load
