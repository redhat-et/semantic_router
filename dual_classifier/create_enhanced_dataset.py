Enhanced Dataset Creator for Dual-Purpose Classification Model

This script creates a new dataset with the following categories:
- Math: Mathematical problems and solutions
- History: Historical texts and discussions  
- Health: Medical and health-related content
- Programming: Code and programming-related content
- General: General knowledge and miscellaneous content

Uses HuggingFace datasets to source high-quality content for each category.
